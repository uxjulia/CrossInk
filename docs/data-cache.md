# Data Cache

CrossInk caches data aggressively on the SD card to minimize RAM use. The ESP32-C3 has about 380 KB of usable RAM, so rebuilding every book structure in memory on every open would be too expensive.

The main data directory is `.crosspoint` on the SD card. It stores render caches and persistent user/device data.

## Directory Layout

```text

## Clearing Cache Data

Deleting the entire `.crosspoint` directory resets caches, settings, saved network/server data, bookmarks, recent books, reading progress, and reading stats.

To clear EPUB/XTC render caches from the device UI without deleting settings or global stats, use:

**Settings > System > Files & Cache > Clear Reading Cache**

## Book Moves And Cache Identity

Cache folders are path-based. Moving a book file can create a new cache directory, so the moved copy may start with fresh reading progress unless the firmware migrates the cache for that move. CrossInk migrates cache and bookmark data for the built-in move-to-Read flow and related file-browser move actions.

Cache data is cleared by supported CrossInk delete/move flows. If you remove or rename books outside CrossInk by editing the SD card directly, old cache folders may remain until you clear reading cache.

All-time reading stats can also be backed up outside `.crosspoint` in:

```text
/.crossink-stats-backup/
```
