- Xteink X4 Classic support, including its six buttons, SD card, USB Drive, display profile, and board-specific firmware builds.
- Custom boot screens: put BMP images in a `/bootscreen` or `/.bootscreen` folder (case-insensitive) and CrossInk rotates through them on cold boot and power-button wake, or choose Set as Boot Screen for any BMP in the File Browser to always show that image. With no folder or selected image configured, boot looks exactly as before.
- Full Xteink X4 Pro support, including USB Drive access to its SD card and direct USB file transfers.
- Frontlit readers can choose Never for periodic full-screen refreshes, and Night Mode now applies system-wide for ESP32-S3 devices.

- Quick Actions provides a menu of favorite reader commands, assignable to Power + Up and, on X4 Pro, Home-button gestures.
- A new Quick Lock shortcut locks the device without putting it to sleep; it uses the regular sleep timeout and can be assigned to Power + Up, long-press Back or Menu, or any X4 Pro Home-button shortcut.
- Shortcuts can now go to the previous page or start Nearby Position Sync from an EPUB reader.
- Dictionary lookups can now save the selected word or phrase directly as a clipping on touch devices.

- OPDS search accepts the first Confirm press after closing the keyboard, OPDS lists retain their standard Back header, and web Settings handles older saved KOReader passwords.
- KOReader Sync treats an empty response as no remote position and no longer interleaves its progress with EPUB image pages; its settings also persist after returning from lightweight network screens.
- Nearby Position Sync leaves the sender with one Back action and handles repeated packets more reliably, while Nearby Stats Sync exposes Sync and Cancel on touch readers.

- Web uploads and KOReader Sync progress saves now preserve progress, stats, settings, and valid resume data for refreshed book files.
- OPDS low-memory handling now shows a specific parser-buffer memory message and releases SD-card fonts before catalog loading.
- EPUB cache, CSS, table, SD-card font, and allocation failure paths now recover, retry, or stop cleanly under low memory instead of opening unstyled pages, failing unnecessarily, or risking a reboot.
- EPUB text with invisible word-joiner characters no longer shows replacement diamonds for missing font glyphs.
- Clarified the low-memory EPUB image warning so it says some or all images may be missing.

## [v1.3.0] - 2026-05-21

### Added

- Back/Cancel support while downloading books from OPDS catalogs.
- Recent Books long-press menu in both List and Grid views with delete, cache delete, completion, and remove-from-recents actions.
- Minimal sleep screen option that shows the current book cover and reading progress on a dark background.
- More detailed WiFi connection debug logs for scans, selected networks, status changes, disconnect reasons, and timeouts.
- 9pt `Itty Bitty` reader font size, plus build flags for omitting Itty Bitty and Large reader font assets in size-constrained firmware variants.
- In-reader confirmation message when a shortcut turns tilt-to-turn on or off.

### Fixed

- WiFi and OPDS connection-flow edge cases: manual Settings connections now show the connected status before continuing, copied or corrupted saved-password files are rejected before use, OPDS retries show loading before requests, and large OPDS feeds fail safely under low memory instead of rebooting.
- Reader and Home UI polish issues, including landscape status-bar settings, missing Vietnamese labels, File Browser and Lyra Carousel icon alignment, cover thumbnail artifacts, and duplicate Home progress/stat loading.
- EPUB cache and low-memory handling now use stable cache folder keys, migrate older cache folders where possible, rebuild stale section caches, lay out very long text blocks earlier, stream table fallback content when heap is tight, and clarify the warning text.
- Sleep-entry, network, and SD-card font download reliability improvements: cached sleep-screen assets are reused, OPDS pages idle normally after load, the X3 tilt sensor sleeps outside the reader, WiFi power saving is disabled during transfers, WebDAV stack usage is lower, longer stalls are tolerated, interrupted font files are retried, and active reader fonts are freed when needed.
- Remaining reader service edge cases, including an XTC chapter selector crash on memory-constrained builds, SD-card font size selection, SD-card font-size shortcuts skipping manually installed sizes, and KOReader Sync login compatibility with self-hosted servers that return valid JSON on success.

### Changed

- Modified upstream "page-as-sleep" behavior into a new `Sleep Screen > Quick Resume` option, which also keeps `Quick Resume on Timeout` on, and renamed the timeout-only toggle.
- Improved reader and browser menu behavior by moving the Footnotes shortcut above Select Chapter, wrapping long book titles in action menus, and reducing progress-screen repaint work during OPDS and SD font downloads.

## [v1.2.11.1] - 2026-05-15

### Changed

- Removed Medium font size from `xlarge` build to get it below the size limit

### Fixed

- Lyra Carousel is now included by activating the build flag `DCROSSINK_ENABLE_LYRA_CAROUSEL=1`

---

## [v1.2.11] - 2026-05-14

### Added

- New personal theme: "Minimal"
- Custom sleep timer picker so `Time to Sleep` can be set from 1 to 30 minutes instead of cycling fixed presets.
- In-reader Controls shortcut for customizing buttons without leaving the book.
- Bookmark cleanup shortcuts: hold Select on a bookmark to delete it, or hold Open on a book in Bookmarks to clear that book's bookmark list.
- Confirmation message after deleting a book's cache from the reader or File Browser.
- File Browser long-press action for deleting an EPUB or XTC book's cache.
- Downloaded-font size range setting so SD-card fonts can use compact, default, or large point-size sets.
- File Browser long-press action for marking EPUB books as finished or unfinished.

### Changed

- Hardened deep sleep entry by shutting WiFi down before waiting for the power button to be released.
- Raised the web file-transfer filename limit from 100 to 150 bytes so longer uploaded filenames are preserved.
- Made the in-reader Reader Options menu include the same Reader settings and actions as Settings > Reader.
- Split SD-card font descriptions and supported languages into separate lines in the font download screen.

### Fixed

- Inline EPUB images no longer disappear in landscape when their bottom edge slightly overlaps the screen margin.
- Reduced unnecessary low-memory image suppression for JPEG-heavy EPUB chapters and added CSS heap diagnostics during chapter rebuilds.
- Allowed wider inline JPEG images in EPUBs to render when they still fit the total pixel and heap safety limits.
- SD-card font picker no longer reopens immediately after selecting a font from Settings > Reader > Font Family.
- In-reader font-size changes now work for SD-card fonts.
- In-reader SD-card font changes now rebuild the current EPUB page layout consistently.

## [v1.2.10] - 2026-05-11

### Added

- `Recent Books View` setting so the dedicated Recent Books screen can switch between the classic list and a 3x3 cover grid.
- More flexible reader controls, including orientation-aware front/side button settings, nav-only or all-button front inversion, tilt page turn shortcuts, and side-button long-press rotation actions.
- Per-session auto page turn interval picker with values from 5 to 120 seconds.
- File Browser Home/Back long-press action for toggling hidden files and folders.
- EPUB rendering and diagnostics improvements, including visible `<hr>` separators and heap logs around section rebuilds, image extraction, page serialization, and sleep-cache rebuilds.
- Reader font coverage for block redactions, black-square ornaments, Greek category letters, and turned-comma punctuation (PR #104).
- Simulator tools for testing sleep/wake behavior and smoke-testing common screens and EPUB reader menus.

### Changed

- Reduced Controls settings section spacing so the grouped controls fit better on X3 screens.
- Made front reader long-press actions trigger when the hold delay is reached while normal page turns still trigger on release.
- Used the fast EPUB spine/TOC indexing path for books with 300+ spine entries so heavily split books build `book.bin` faster on first open.
- Allowed the web file manager and WebDAV to browse dot-prefixed hidden files when hidden files are enabled, matching the device file browser.

### Fixed

- Reader button and shortcut behavior, including X3 power-button wake filtering, folder delete long-press timing, and WiFi scan/connect screens that could not be exited while work was in progress.
- RoundedRaff home-menu, keyboard, and button-hint rendering issues so Settings remains reachable and compact labels no longer overlap or disappear.
- Font and glyph handling now reduces persistent SD-card font advance-cache memory, releases optional font caches before image extraction only when heap is tight, and shows a visible replacement symbol when compact UI fonts lack `U+FFFD`.
- KOReader Sync authentication diagnostics and an in-reader sync crash, including clearer handling when a server or proxy returns non-JSON content.
- EPUB text rendering for redactions, whitespace-only XHTML text nodes, simple black CSS span backgrounds, list bullets in `<li><p>...</p></li>` items, and very long base64-like text runs.
- EPUB image, thumbnail, and section-rebuild stability so image-heavy chapters use less temporary memory, scale images more reliably, avoid stale dimensions, and suppress optional image work earlier under heap pressure.
- EPUB low-memory and cache safety now skips optional next-chapter indexing and sleep-page cache rebuilds when heap is tight, fails safely with a malformed-book warning and Home exit path, rebuilds incompatible fork-written caches, and handles low-memory CSS parsing, truncated SD writes, invalid serialized strings, and failed temp-cache promotion.
- Home no longer crashes after clearing reading cache when the source EPUB cache is missing.
- Reader prewarm behavior now skips image decoding, keeps mixed-style font glyphs cached together, and avoids section rebuilds for render-quality-only option changes.
- Concurrent render/storage crashes are avoided by serializing `GfxRenderer` scratch-buffer access, shared SPI bus access, and failed SPI lock cleanup.
- Recent Books, EPUB/XTC thumbnail caches, deleted-folder metadata, and XTC cover scaling now keep cached book data in sync and grid covers fill their slots correctly.
- Simulator build configuration now lets SDL2 and simulator-provided network/OTA shims compile cleanly.

---

## [v1.2.9.1] - 2026-05-03

### Changed

- Cleaned up EPUB table rendering by removing synthetic row/cell labels and defaulting table cells to readable left alignment
- Allow simple EPUB tables with full-width note rows so a single `colspan` cell spanning the whole table no longer forces the entire table back to paragraph fallback

### Fixed

- Power-button shortcut conflicts outside the reader so reader-only actions fall back to `Confirm` while Sleep, Refresh, Screenshot, Sync Progress, and File Transfer remain real power actions.
- Potential crash when using `Go to %` in EPUBs.
- Potential crash when entering sleep with Page Overlay enabled if the cached EPUB page data is invalid.
